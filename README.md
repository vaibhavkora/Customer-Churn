# Loan Approval Prediction


# 📌Project Overview

This project is a Loan Approval Prediction System that utilizes Machine Learning algorithms to predict whether a loan application should be approved. The model is trained on various financial and demographic features to assess creditworthiness.

# 📊Dataset

The dataset contains the following key attributes:

- **Applicant Income**: The monthly income of the applicant
- **Co-applicant Income**: Monthly income of co-applicant (if any)
- **Loan Amount**: Requested loan amount
- **Loan Amount Term**: Duration of the loan in months
- **Credit History**: Applicant’s credit history (0 or 1)
- **Property Area**: Urban, Semi-Urban, or Rural Marital Status, Gender, Education, Self-Employed: Demographic information

# 🛠️Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data preprocessing)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning models)
- Jupyter Notebook (Development environment)
